/**
 * A memory slab with a bitmap: it allocates a large buffer (the slab) and it slices it
 * into smaller buffers when requested. The only supported slice size is the bufferSize,
 * where bufferSize is specified in the constructor. The buffer size must be a power of two
 * and the slab size, or the capacity of the slab, should be a multiple of the buffer size
 * and a power of 2.
 *
 * Each bufferSize is allocated to a bit in an integer.
 * A bit is set to 1 to indicate the corresponding buffer is available, and to 0 to indicate that it is in use.
 * Multiple integers are appended into an array, the buffers allocations bitmap, to produce a bitmap that covers
 * the entire slab.
 *
 * When multiple buffers are requested, the pool will try to use consecutive addresses, if they are available.
 *
 * When a buffer is released, the pool works out the position in the bitmap by comparing the buffer
 * address to its base address, and it releases the corresponding bit in the bitmap.
