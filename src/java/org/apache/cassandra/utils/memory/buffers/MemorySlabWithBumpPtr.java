/**
 * A memory slab with a simple bump-the-pointer strategy: it allocates a large buffer (the slab) and it slices it
 * into smaller buffers when requested. A pointer tracks the position of the memory in the slab that is still free.
 * Once the end of the slab is reached, no more buffers are served. Different buffer sizes are supported and buffer
 * start positions are always page aligned.
 * <p/>
 * Once the end of the slab is reached and no more buffers can be issued, then the slab can no longer be used
 * but it's memory can be recycled by creating a new slab with the same memory. This can only be done when all
 * the served buffers have been released. For this purpose a reference counter is incremented when the slab is created
 * and each time a buffer is returned. When the reference count has reached zero, the memory can be recycled.
 * <p/>
 * This class assumes that only one thread can release the initial reference count in the constructor and destroy
 * or recycle the memory. Multiple threads can however take and return buffers. The thread that must release the initial
 * reference count receives a special buffer from {@link this#allocate(int)}: {@link this#BOUNDARY_CROSSED}.
 * The thread that receives this buffer, must unreference the slab and retry the allocation with a new slab.
 * {@link this#unreference()} must be called only once.
 * <p/>
 * Both {@link #unreference()} and {@link #release(ByteBuffer)} return a boolean. Only one caller will
 * receive true, when the reference count reaches zero. The caller that receives
 * true must either destroy this slab or recycle it into a new one by calling {@link #destroy()} or {@link #recycle()}
 * respectively. {@link #unreference()} must be called exactly once per byte buffer returned and once for the entire slab,
 * it cannot be called more times than this.
 * <p/>
 * Once destroyed or recycled, the number of references is set to a negative value. At this point the
 * slab cannot be used and {@link #allocate(int)} will return null. {@link #recycle()} and  {@link #destroy()} will
 * throw an {@link AssertionError} or an {@link IllegalStateException} if called again.
